# giphyapp

Is a single page web application that allows the user to generate a selected number of gifs from a provided list of categories. The provided categories manifest as buttons which the user may then click in order to generate the gifs. The gifs that appear are static until the user clicks them. Each click either 'starts' or 'stops' a chosen gif's animation. The user may also add new category buttons in the 'make a gif button' button input.
